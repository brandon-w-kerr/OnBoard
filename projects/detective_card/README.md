# "dectective_card"

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I made a card that I can use to allow people to look at my projects from github very easily. The card is based off the anime "Yu Yu Hakusho." The main character calls himself a "Spirit Detective"
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
At least $18
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Considering I have never done something like this before, I was following the tutorial to the best of my ability so im hoping that it worked! Finding the correct photos to use on the character was really difficult because I had to find a panel and erase the background without getting rid of any of the character's details
